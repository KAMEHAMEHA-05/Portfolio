## Introduction

Welcome to **Project Cosmos**, an initiative dedicated to exploring the vast wonders of our universe. This document provides an overview of our mission, key research areas, and upcoming events.

*The cosmos is all that is or was or ever will be. Our feeblest contemplations of the Cosmos stir us — there is a tingling in the spine, a catch in the voice, a faint sensation, as if a distant memory, of falling from a height. We know we are approaching the greatest of mysteries.* — Carl Sagan

## Key Research Areas

### 1. Exoplanet Discovery

Our team uses advanced techniques to identify planets beyond our solar system:

- Transit method
- Radial velocity measurements
- Direct imaging
- Gravitational microlensing

### 2. Black Hole Research

| Black Hole Type | Typical Mass | Formation |
|-----------------|--------------|-----------|
| Stellar | 5-100 solar masses | Core collapse of massive stars |
| Intermediate | 100-100,000 solar masses | Unclear; possibly mergers |
| Supermassive | 10^6-10^10 solar masses | Galaxy formation processes |

### 3. Dark Matter Investigation

> "Dark matter is a mysterious substance that makes up approximately 85% of the matter in the universe, yet it doesn't interact with light or other electromagnetic radiation." 

## Code Examples

Our data analysis relies on Python:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def analyze_stellar_data(data_file):
    data = np.loadtxt(data_file)
    luminosity = data[:, 0]
    temperature = data[:, 1]
    
    plt.scatter(temperature, luminosity)
    plt.xlabel('Temperature (K)')
    plt.ylabel('Luminosity (L☉)')
    plt.title('H-R Diagram')
    plt.gca().invert_xaxis()
    plt.yscale('log')
    plt.show()
    
    return np.mean(luminosity), np.std(temperature)
```
